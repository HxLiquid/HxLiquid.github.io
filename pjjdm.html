        Each player spawns with a random hero, fusion, enchant, and trait which will give them an edge in battle.<br>
        Some fusions have passive abilities, while others require you to press buttons (most commonly interact) to use.<br>
        Rarely, final blows can get you an additional ultimate fusion which will power you up even further.<br>
        Excluding ultimate fusions, there are over  <span style="color: #3FBF74"><b>12,840</b></span> different combinations you can acquire!<br>
        (Don't start the gamemode!)</b></p>
